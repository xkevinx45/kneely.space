      <title>Static Websites &#43; JAMstack = &lt;3</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure that by now you&amp;rsquo;ve heard about how static websites are the best thing since sliced bread. If you&amp;rsquo;re the type to stay on top of the latest, then you&amp;rsquo;ve also heard about Smashing Magazine ditching WordPress and moving to a JAMstack (probably how you ended up here).
JAMstack stands for JavaScript, APIs, &amp;amp; Markup; it’s an approach to building websites that allows you to have all the web performance and security benefits of a static website along with the dynamic capabilities of a database-driven CMS.</description>

      <title>Progressive Web Apps — The Next Step in Responsive Web Design</title>

      <description>Late last week, Smashing Magazine, one of the largest and most influential online publications for web design, posted on Facebook that their website was “now running as a Progressive Web App.”
 Honestly, I didn’t think much of it. Progressive Web Apps are for the hardcore web application developers creating the next online cloud-based Photoshop (complicated stuff), right? I scrolled on and went about my day.
Then, I saw CSS wizard, Harry Roberts, tweet about making some setting changes in CloudFlare and achieving the same.</description>

      <title>User-Friendly Exit Intent Modals</title>
      <link>https://julian.is/article/exit-intent-popups/</link>

      <description>As users, we hate popups. We never click on them. They’re annoying. They get in the way. But as conversion rate optimizers, they just work. They produce results by making themselves very difficult to ignore, and believe it or not, people do convert on these. Good news, though — somewhere, somehow, someone was able to find a middle ground to this. It’s what we call “exit intent modals” or, if you prefer to sound Google smart, “exit intent interstitials.</description>

      <title>A Simple Baseline for Fast Loading Accessible Websites</title>
      <link>https://julian.is/article/baseline-for-fast-loading-websites/</link>

      <description>Websites have reached a point where the maturity of graphic design has caught up with the state of web development. But what about accessibility? As the web keeps getting prettier to look at, it also keeps getting heavier and slower to load. Page speed is a limitation that influences creativity and impacts accessibility, but unfortunately it is also a behind the scenes act that usually gets overlooked.
Saving images for the web isn’t cutting it anymore; we now have to take into consideration perceived load time, Gzip, CDNs, post-photoshop image optimization, etc, just to make our websites accessible (and to make Google happy, let’s not forget).</description>

      <title>INBOUND 2016 — A Designer&#39;s Perspective with a Roundup of Tools</title>

      <description>It’s difficult for some folks to see the value in a designer attending a marketing conference such as INBOUND 2016, but anyone with a decent understanding of design knows that with context, you create better work. The best designs were not put together by a designer working in isolation, the best designs were put together by a designer that was aware of the material and concept at hand with an understanding that went beyond the surface level.</description>

      <title>Growth-Driven Design Case Study</title>

      <description>Over the past year, we at Results-Powered Marketing (the agency I work for) have integrated Growth-Driven Design into our approach to building and maintaining websites. For those unfamiliar, GDD is an agile approach applied to the website development process — the goal is to get something out the door as soon as possible, test, iterate, and keep making tweaks to drive better and stronger results for our clients.
In this specific case study, we were able to increase our client&amp;rsquo;s new monthly leads generated by 278%.</description>

      <description>First day was a blast. Learned a ton of new stuff that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t privy to before (and able to use in production). I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to say that the second day has been even better. Again, just a disclaimer that these notes weren&amp;rsquo;t edited and they were added just as they were jotted down. Enjoy!

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve made it all the way out to Barcelona for my second SmashingConf. I&amp;rsquo;ve attended plenty of conferences in the states but I wanted to learn something new in regards to both culture and web design. Needless to say, the first day at SmashingConf and my second day in Barcelona did not fall short of expectations.
Below are some of the notes I&amp;rsquo;ve taken during the first day of talks. Keep in mind that these notes weren&amp;rsquo;t edited and they were added just as they were jotted down.</description>

      <description>Why not? I spend most of my days trying to figure out design; whether I&amp;rsquo;m working with a junior designer trying to teach him/her a certain web design concept or I&amp;rsquo;m figuring out a stubborn front-end development bug, documentation on what I come across on a daily basis could be of good use to other designers in my field of work.
What to expect There are three areas of web design in which I mostly focus on:</description>
