      <description>As users, we hate popups. We never click on them. They’re annoying. They get in the way. But as conversion rate optimizers, they just work. They produce results by making themselves very difficult to ignore, and believe it or not, people do convert on these. Good news, though — somewhere, somehow, someone was able to find a middle ground to this. It’s what we call “exit intent modals” or, if you prefer to sound Google smart, “exit intent interstitials.</description>

      <description>Over the past year, we at Results-Powered Marketing (the agency I work for) have integrated Growth-Driven Design into our approach to building and maintaining websites. For those unfamiliar, GDD is an agile approach applied to the website development process — the goal is to get something out the door as soon as possible, test, iterate, and keep making tweaks to drive better and stronger results for our clients.
In this specific case study, we were able to increase our client&amp;rsquo;s new monthly leads generated by 278%.</description>

      <title>SmashingConf Barcelona 2016 Day 2 Notes</title>

      <description>First day was a blast. Learned a ton of new stuff that I wasn&amp;rsquo;t privy to before (and able to use in production). I&amp;rsquo;m surprised to say that the second day has been even better. Again, just a disclaimer that these notes weren&amp;rsquo;t edited and they were added just as they were jotted down. Enjoy!
